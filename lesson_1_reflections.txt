   You are the only person that know your work, so you are the correct person to decide when a change is really done.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

  Because they are focused on different kind of documents. For binary documents, like Google Docs, simultaneus control of several documents doesn't make sense.

 How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

   it's very easy. A piece of cake.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

   Because if you make an error, you can easily undo the changes...

 Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

   For making the more fantastic programs on the world
